#[1] Set up libraries
```{r loadlibs, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Put all libraries here.

# Put global display options here
options(digits=2)

# This flag is to control whether analytic code blocks should display
# the code itself.
# When turning in work, you should knit two pdfs, 
# with this variable set to FALSE and TRUE respectively.
# When FALSE you have a nice report with results only.  When TRUE you have 
# the code itself so we can see what you did.
show.code = FALSE
# show.code = TRUE # just comment this line out to make it false

# This controls whether the code for making plots should be shown.
# When turning in your work, you should leave this as FALSE, 
# unless there is something about your plots that is not working as it should.
show.plot.code = show.code
show.plot.code = FALSE #  comment this out to make it follow the overall config

#some colleges are better than other, so they will just raise everybody, so that's college-level random effect
#there's some completion rate by race, that's the grand mean, change in completion rate, which is impacted by instution which will raise everyone up or down, which is impacted by state and sector
